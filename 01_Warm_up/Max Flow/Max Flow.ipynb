Applications of the max flow problem include finding the maximum flow of orders through a job shop, the maximum flow of water through a storm sewer system, and the maximum flow of product through a product distribution system, among others. Schrijver (2002) note that the maximum flow problem was first formulated in 1954 by T. E. Harris and F. S. Ross as a simplified model of Soviet railway traffic flow.\n","\n","A network is a directed graph, and the arc capacities, or upper bounds, are the only relevant parameters. A network graph does not have to be symmetric: if an arc (v,w) is in the graph, the reverse arc (w,v) does not have to be in the graph. Further, parallel arcs are not allowed, and self-loops are not allowed. The source and the sink are distinct nodes in the network, but the sink may be unreachable from the source.**bold text**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pnQ_w8FWW1NG"},"source":["## Problem Statement\n","\n","The max flow problem can be formulated mathematically as a linear programming problem using the following model.\n","\n","\n","### Sets\n","\n"," $N$ = nodes in the network <br />\n"," $A$ = network arcs\n","\n","### Parameters\n","\n"," $s$     = source node <br />\n"," $t$     = sink node <br />\n"," $c_{i,j}$ = arc flow capacity, $\\forall (i,j) \\in A$ <br />\n","\n","### Variables\n"," $f_{i,j}$ = arc flow capacity $\\forall (i,j) \\in A$ <br />\n","### Objective\n","\n","Maximize the flow into the sink nodes <br />\n","$\\max \\sum_{\\{i|(i,t) \\in A\\}} c_{i,t} f_{i,t}$\n","\n","### Constraints\n","\n","\n","Enforce an upper limit on the flow across each arc <br />\n"," $f_{i,j} \\leq c_{i,j}$, $\\forall (i,j) \\in A$\n"," \n","Enforce flow through each node: <br />\n"," $\\sum_{\\{i|(i,t) \\in A\\}} f_{i,j}= \\sum_{\\{i|(i,t) \\in A\\}} f_{j,i}, \\forall j \\in N - \\{ s,t \\}$\n","\n","Flow lower bound <br />\n"," $f_{i,j} \\geq 0$, $\\forall (i,j) \\in A$"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Gwjd6Z19h91M"},"source":["###Pyomo Formulation\n","We begin by importing the Pyomo package and creating a model object:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1HeH06n6ggXi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1617502154344,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":21798,"user":{"displayName":"Adrian Moreno Garcia","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiXQ1ZK6UFJZr3QP9hx-PeRMubD_aper-uplvJdjQ=s64","userId":"17171194756348322850"}}},"source":["from pyomo.environ import *\n","\n","model = AbstractModel()"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aW6EHfDjiREl"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NN84juHhiRQm"},"source":["The sets $N$ and $A$ are declared abstractly using the Set component:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cfczZypjgggP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1617502154352,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":21787,"user":{"displayName":"Adrian Moreno Garcia","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiXQ1ZK6UFJZr3QP9hx-PeRMubD_aper-uplvJdjQ=s64","userId":"17171194756348322850"}}},"source":["# Nodes in the network\n","model.N = Set()\n","# Network arcs\n","model.A = Set(within=model.N*model.N)\n"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"x3DU26yribj9"},"source":["\n","Similarly, the model parameters are defined abstractly using the **Param** component:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Gm13Jgsqg2fN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1617502154357,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":21777,"user":{"displayName":"Adrian Moreno Garcia","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiXQ1ZK6UFJZr3QP9hx-PeRMubD_aper-uplvJdjQ=s64","userId":"17171194756348322850"}}},"source":["# Source node\n","model.s = Param(within=model.N)\n","# Sink node\n","model.t = Param(within=model.N)\n","# Flow capacity limits\n","model.c = Param(model.A)"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WWF6Pf9aijYe"},"source":["The **within** option is used in these parameter declarations to define expected properties of the parameters.

As a city planner, you were given a map of routes from the zoo to Home, along with the estimated number of families that could go on each route. Additionally, it was estimated that 16 families from Home will visit each day, and it's your task to figure out if this will overload the public transportation system, and, if it does, how could the system be improved?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JkZRgRMRZFk7"},"source":["#### Solution"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fe5lX46Aa5UI"},"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0ywcScLOa5kb"},"source":["Pyomo includes a **pyomo** command that automates the construction and optimization of models.
